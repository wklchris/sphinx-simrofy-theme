Welcome to sphinx-simrofy-theme's documentation!
================================================

Simrofy is a theme for the Sphinx_ documentation generator. It is NOT designed for writing techinical documenation, but for building a portfolio/CV website to introduce yourself to those who may concern. 

Simrofy was intendedly developed to build personal neat website to share around academia, so it owns some features merely useful for academic users. However, Simrofy also serves well as an easy-to-use static website choice for non-academic users.
